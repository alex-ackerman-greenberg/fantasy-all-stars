# fantasy-all-stars
A dumb game for fantasy degenerates.

The rules of the game are simple. Each week, pick one (and exactly one) player from each opposing team in your fantasy league to build a roster of Fantasy All Stars.
You cannot pick anyone from your own team.
In this version of the game, teams consist of 2 QB, 3 RB, 3 WR, 2 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 DS/T, 1 K. (13 players for a 14 team league).
Players must be playing on Sunday. No Thursday or Monday games allowed to encourage variety of player pools each week.
The team with the most points at the end of the Sunday slate of games wins.

What should we change to make this better/usable by anyone? We need to build out configurations to:
Use your own google sheets and ESPN credentials.
Generate a new google sheet template for you.
Change roster makeup to account for league size (or just generally allow for flexibility here).
Add automatations that clear out team rosters at the end of a week, generate new matchup tabs, and automatically kick off the data pulls for your team at game start.
Ideally, we add some notification mechanisms too, reminding people to set their lineups, giving updates on current scores at the end of the 1pm and 4pm games, and then final tally at the end of the matchup week to congratulate winner.
